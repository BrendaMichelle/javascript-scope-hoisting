![alt text](/pics/js-encouragement.jpg "You got this!")
### Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain what *scope* is
2. Describe the difference between *var*, *let*, & *const*
3. Demonstrate understanding of *global scope* vs *function scope* vs *block scope*
4. Explain what *hoisting* is

## What is [Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)?

Scope refers to the accessibility of a variable from certain contexts in your code. If a variable or another expression is not in the "current scope", then it means that we cannot use that variable or expression. If we try to use a variable that is not in the current scope, then we will get an error or unexpected/unintended behavior. Not good! We can avoid a lot of debugging headaches if we understand scope!

#### Closures

#### Global Scope

#### Function Scope

#### Block Scope

## [Var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)



## [Let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) 


## [Const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)


## Why bother declaring a variable with one of these keywords??


## What is [Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)?
